Sample Bug Out Bag Checklist

Note:
 This checklist includes the items I would take in a bug-out
 situation in which I had to head out into the wilds of the Lower
 48 States on foot.  Using a vehicle, boat, or other means of
 carrying gear would allow much more flexibility. This list will
 need to be adjusted for high elevations or northern winters.
